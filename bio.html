	<p class=bio>I'm currently a sophomore at Tufts University studying Cognitive and Brain Science, which combines psychology, computer science, philosophy, and child development. I love working with kids, and have been a camp counselor for 3 years as well as a coordinator for a group pairing Tufts student mentors with local preschoolers. When I'm not in class, I love baking desserts, reading books, drawing, exploring, and dancing.</p>
